# MiniMax Multi-Modal Toolkit

Generate voice, music, video, and image content via MiniMax APIs — the unified entry for **MiniMax multimodal** use cases (audio + music + video + image). Includes voice cloning & voice design for custom voices, image generation with character reference, and FFmpeg-based media tools for audio/video format conversion, concatenation, trimming, and extraction.

## Output Directory

**All generated files MUST be saved to `minimax-output/` under the AGENT'S current working directory (NOT the skill directory).** Every script call MUST include an explicit `--output` / `-o` argument pointing to this location. Never omit the output argument or rely on script defaults.

**Rules:**
1. Before running any script, ensure `minimax-output/` exists in the agent's working directory (create if needed: `mkdir -p minimax-output`)
2. Always use absolute or relative paths from the agent's working directory: `--output minimax-output/video.mp4`
3. **Never** `cd` into the skill directory to run scripts — run from the agent's working directory using the full script path
4. Intermediate/temp files (segment audio, video segments, extracted frames) are automatically placed in `minimax-output/tmp/`. They can be cleaned up when no longer needed: `rm -rf minimax-output/tmp`

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install ffmpeg jq              # macOS (or apt install ffmpeg jq on Linux)
bash scripts/check_environment.sh
```

No Python or pip required — all scripts are pure bash using `curl`, `ffmpeg`, `jq`, and `xxd`.

### API Host Configuration

MiniMax provides two service endpoints for different regions. Set `MINIMAX_API_HOST` before running any script:

| Region | Platform URL | API Host Value |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| China Mainland（中国大陆） | https://platform.minimaxi.com | `https://api.minimaxi.com` |
| Global（全球） | https://platform.minimax.io | `https://api.minimax.io` |

```bash
# China Mainland
export MINIMAX_API_HOST="https://api.minimaxi.com"

# or Global
export MINIMAX_API_HOST="https://api.minimax.io"
```

**IMPORTANT — When API Host is missing:**
Before running any script, check if `MINIMAX_API_HOST` is set in the environment. If it is NOT configured:
1. Ask the user which service endpoint their MiniMax account uses:
   - **China Mainland** → `https://api.minimaxi.com`
   - **Global** → `https://api.minimax.io`
2. Instruct and help user to set it via `export MINIMAX_API_HOST="https://api.minimaxi.com"` (or the global variant) in their terminal or add it to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`) for persistence

### API Key Configuration

Set the `MINIMAX_API_KEY` environment variable before running any script:

```bash
export MINIMAX_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

The key starts with `sk-api-` or `sk-cp-`, obtainable from https://platform.minimaxi.com (China) or https://platform.minimax.io (Global)

**IMPORTANT — When API Key is missing:**
Before running any script, check if `MINIMAX_API_KEY` is set in the environment. If it is NOT configured:
1. Ask the user to provide their MiniMax API key
2. Instruct and help user to set it via `export MINIMAX_API_KEY="sk-..."` in their terminal or add it to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc`) for persistence

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Entry point |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| TTS | Text-to-speech synthesis with multiple voices and emotions | `scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh` |
| Voice Cloning | Clone a voice from an audio sample (10s–5min) | `scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh clone` |
| Voice Design | Create a custom voice from a text description | `scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh design` |
| Music Generation | Generate songs with lyrics or instrumental tracks | `scripts/music/generate_music.sh` |
| Image Generation | Text-to-image, image-to-image with character reference | `scripts/image/generate_image.sh` |
| Video Generation | Text-to-video, image-to-video, subject reference, templates | `scripts/video/generate_video.sh` |
| Long Video | Multi-scene chained video with crossfade transitions | `scripts/video/generate_long_video.sh` |
| Media Tools | Audio/video format conversion, concatenation, trimming, extraction | `scripts/media_tools.sh` |

## TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Entry point: `scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh`

### IMPORTANT: Single voice vs Multi-segment — Choose the right approach

| User intent | Approach |
|-------------|----------|
| Single voice / no multi-character need | `tts` command — generate the entire text in one call |
| Multiple characters / narrator + dialogue | `generate` command with segments.json |

**Default behavior:** When the user simply asks to generate speech/voice and does NOT mention multiple voices or characters, use the `tts` command directly with a single appropriate voice. Do NOT split into segments or use the multi-segment pipeline — just pass the full text to `tts` in one call.

Only use multi-segment `generate` when:
- The user explicitly needs multiple voices/characters
- The text requires narrator + character dialogue separation
- The text exceeds **10,000 characters** (API limit per request) — in this case, split into segments with the same voice

### Single-voice generation (DEFAULT)

```bash
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh tts "Hello world" -o minimax-output/hello.mp3
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh tts "你好世界" -v female-shaonv -o minimax-output/hello_cn.mp3
```

### Multi-segment generation (multi-voice / audiobook / podcast)

**Complete workflow — follow ALL steps in order:**

1. **Write segments.json** — split text into segments with voice assignments (see format and rules below)
2. **Run `generate` command** — this reads segments.json, generates audio for EACH segment via TTS API, then merges them into a single output file with crossfade

```bash
# Step 1: Write segments.json to minimax-output/
# (use the Write tool to create minimax-output/segments.json)

# Step 2: Generate audio from segments.json — this is the CRITICAL step
# It generates each segment individually and merges them into one file
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh generate minimax-output/segments.json \
  -o minimax-output/output.mp3 --crossfade 200
```

**Do NOT skip Step 2.** Writing segments.json alone does nothing — you MUST run the `generate` command to actually produce audio.

### Voice management

```bash
# List all available voices
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh list-voices

# Voice cloning (from audio sample, 10s–5min)
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh clone sample.mp3 --voice-id my-voice

# Voice design (from text description)
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh design "A warm female narrator voice" --voice-id narrator
```

### Audio processing

```bash
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh merge part1.mp3 part2.mp3 -o minimax-output/combined.mp3
bash scripts/tts/generate_voice.sh convert input.wav -o minimax-output/output.mp3
```

### TTS Models

| Model | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| speech-2.8-hd | Recommended, auto emotion matching |
| speech-2.8-turbo | Faster variant |
| speech-2.6-hd | Previous gen, manual emotion |
| speech-2.6-turbo | Previous gen, faster |

### segments.json Format

Default crossfade between segments: **200ms** (`--crossfade 200`).

```json
[
  { "text": "Hello!", "voice_id": "female-shaonv", "emotion": "" },
  { "text": "Welcome.", "voice_id": "male-qn-qingse", "emotion": "happy" }
]
```

Leave `emotion` empty for speech-2.8 models (auto-matched from text).

### IMPORTANT: Multi-Segment Script Generation Rules (Audiobooks, Podcasts, etc.)

When generating segments.json for audiobooks, podcasts, or any multi-character narration, you MUST split narration text from character dialogue into separate segments with distinct voices.

**Rule: Narration and dialogue are ALWAYS separate segments.**

A sentence like `"Tom said: The weather is great today!"` must be split into two segments:
- Segment 1 (narrator voice): `"Tom said:"`
- Segment 2 (character voice): `"The weather is great today!"`

**Example — Audiobook with narrator + 2 characters:**

```json
[
  { "text": "Morning sunlight streamed into the classroom as students filed in one by one.", "voice_id": "narrator-voice", "emotion": "" },
  { "text": "Tom smiled and turned to Lisa:", "voice_id": "narrator-voice", "emotion": "" },
  { "text": "The weather is amazing today! Let's go to the park after school!", "voice_id": "tom-voice", "emotion": "happy" },
  { "text": "Lisa thought for a moment, then replied:", "voice_id": "narrator-voice", "emotion": "" },
  { "text": "Sure, but I need to drop off my backpack at home first.", "voice_id": "lisa-voice", "emotion": "" },
  { "text": "They exchanged a smile and went back to listening to the lecture.", "voice_id": "narrator-voice", "emotion": "" }
]
```

**Key principles:**
1. **Narrator** uses a consistent neutral narrator voice throughout
2. **Each character** has a dedicated voice_id, maintained consistently across all their dialogue
3. **Split at dialogue boundaries** — `"He said:"` is narrator, the quoted content is the character
4. **Do NOT merge** narrator text and character speech into a single segment
5. For characters without pre-existing voice_ids, use voice cloning or voice design to create them first, then reference the created voice_id in segments

## Music Generation

Entry point: `scripts/music/generate_music.sh`

### IMPORTANT: Instrumental vs Lyrics — When to use which

| Scenario | Mode | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| BGM for video / voice / podcast | Instrumental (default) | Use `--instrumental` directly, do NOT ask user |
| User explicitly asks to "create music" / "make a song" | Ask user first | Ask whether they want instrumental or with lyrics |

**When adding background music to video or voice content**, always default to instrumental mode (`--instrumental`). Do not ask the user — BGM should never have vocals competing with the main content.

**When the user explicitly asks to create/generate music as the primary task**, ask them whether they want:
- Instrumental (pure music, no vocals)
- With lyrics (song with vocals — user provides or you help write lyrics)

```bash
# Instrumental (for BGM or when user chooses instrumental)
bash scripts/music/generate_music.sh \
  --instrumental \
  --prompt "ambient electronic, atmospheric" \
  --output minimax-output/ambient.mp3 --download

# Song with lyrics (when user chooses vocal music)
bash scripts/music/generate_music.sh \
  --lyrics "[verse]\nHello world\n[chorus]\nLa la la" \
  --prompt "indie folk, melancholic" \
  --output minimax-output/song.mp3 --download

# With style fields
bash scripts/music/generate_music.sh \
  --lyrics "[verse]\nLyrics here" \
  --genre "pop" --mood "upbeat" --tempo "fast" \
  --output minimax-output/pop_track.mp3 --download
```

### Music Model

Default model: `music-2.5`

`music-2.5` does **not** support `--instrumental` directly. When instrumental music is needed, the script automatically applies a workaround:
- Sets lyrics to `[intro] [outro]` (empty structural tags, no actual vocals), appends `pure music, no lyrics` to the prompt

This produces instrumental-style output without requiring manual intervention. You can always use `--instrumental` and the script handles the rest.

## Image Generation

Entry point: `scripts/image/generate_image.sh`

Model: `image-01` — photorealistic image generation from text prompts, with optional character reference for image-to-image.

### IMPORTANT: Mode Selection — t2i vs i2i

| User intent | Mode |
|-------------|------|
| Generate image from text description (default) | `t2i` — text-to-image |
| Generate image with a character reference photo (keep same person) | `i2i` — image-to-image |

**Default behavior:** When the user asks to generate/create an image without mentioning a reference photo, use `t2i` mode (default). Only use `i2i` mode when the user provides a character reference image or explicitly asks to base the image on an existing person's appearance.

### IMPORTANT: Aspect Ratio — Infer from user context

Do NOT always default to `1:1`. Analyze the user's request and choose the most appropriate aspect ratio:

| User intent / context | Recommended ratio | Resolution |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 头像、图标、社交媒体头像、avatar、icon、profile pic | `1:1` | 1024×1024 |
| 风景、横幅、桌面壁纸、landscape、banner、desktop wallpaper | `16:9` | 1280×720 |
| 传统照片、经典比例、classic photo | `4:3` | 1152×864 |
| 摄影作品、杂志封面、photography、magazine | `3:2` | 1248×832 |
| 人像竖图、海报、portrait photo、poster | `2:3` | 832×1248 |
| 竖版海报、书籍封面、tall poster、book cover | `3:4` | 864×1152 |
| 手机壁纸、社交媒体故事、phone wallpaper、story、reel | `9:16` | 720×1280 |
| 超宽全景、电影画幅、panoramic、cinematic ultrawide | `21:9` | 1344×576 |
| 未指定特定需求 / ambiguous | `1:1` | 1024×1024 |

### IMPORTANT: Image Count — When to generate multiple images

| User intent | Count (`-n`) |
|-------------|--------------|
| Default / single image request | `1` (default) |
| 用户说"几张"、"多张"、"一些" / "a few", "several" | `3` |
| 用户说"多种方案"、"备选" / "variations", "options" | `3`–`4` |
| 用户明确指定数量 | Use the specified number (1–9) |

### Text-to-Image Examples

```bash
# Basic text-to-image
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "A cat sitting on a rooftop at sunset, cinematic lighting, warm tones, photorealistic" \
  -o minimax-output/cat.png

# Landscape with inferred aspect ratio
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "Mountain landscape with misty valleys, photorealistic, golden hour" \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  -o minimax-output/landscape.png

# Phone wallpaper (portrait 9:16)
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "Aurora borealis over a snowy forest, vivid colors, magical atmosphere" \
  --aspect-ratio 9:16 \
  -o minimax-output/wallpaper.png

# Multiple variations
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "Abstract geometric art, vibrant colors" \
  -n 3 \
  -o minimax-output/art.png

# With prompt optimizer
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "A man standing on Venice Beach, 90s documentary style" \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 --prompt-optimizer \
  -o minimax-output/beach.png

# Custom dimensions (must be multiple of 8)
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --prompt "Product photo of a luxury watch on marble surface" \
  --width 1024 --height 768 \
  -o minimax-output/watch.png
```

### Image-to-Image (Character Reference)

Use a reference photo to generate images with the same character in new scenes. Best results with a single front-facing portrait. Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG (max 10MB).

```bash
# Character reference — place same person in a new scene
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --mode i2i \
  --prompt "A girl looking into the distance from a library window, warm afternoon light" \
  --ref-image face.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  -o minimax-output/girl_library.png

# Multiple character variations
bash scripts/image/generate_image.sh \
  --mode i2i \
  --prompt "A woman in a red dress at a gala event, elegant, cinematic" \
  --ref-image face.jpg -n 3 \
  -o minimax-output/gala.png
```

### Aspect Ratio Reference

| Ratio | Resolution | Best for |
|-------|------------|----------|
| `1:1` | 1024×1024 | Default, avatars, icons, social media |
| `16:9` | 1280×720 | Landscape, banner, desktop wallpaper |
| `4:3` | 1152×864 | Classic photo, presentations |
| `3:2` | 1248×832 | Photography, magazine layout |
| `2:3` | 832×1248 | Portrait photo, poster |
| `3:4` | 864×1152 | Book cover, tall poster |
| `9:16` | 720×1280 | Phone wallpaper, social story/reel |
| `21:9` | 1344×576 | Ultra-wide panoramic, cinematic |

### Key Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--prompt TEXT` | Image description, max 1500 chars (required) |
| `--aspect-ratio RATIO` | Aspect ratio (see table above). Infer from user context |
| `--width PX` / `--height PX` | Custom size, 512–2048, must be multiple of 8, both required together. Overridden by `--aspect-ratio` if both set |
| `-n N` | Number of images to generate, 1–9 (default 1) |
| `--seed N` | Random seed for reproducibility. Same seed + same params → similar results |
| `--prompt-optimizer` | Enable automatic prompt optimization by the API |
| `--ref-image FILE` | Character reference image for i2i mode (local file or URL, JPG/JPEG/PNG, max 10MB) |
| `--no-download` | Print image URLs instead of downloading files |
| `--aigc-watermark` | Add AIGC watermark to generated images |

## Video Generation

### IMPORTANT: Single vs Multi-Segment — Choose the right script

| User intent | Script to use |
|-------------|---------------|
| Default / no special request | `scripts/video/generate_video.sh` (single segment, **10s, 768P**) |
| User explicitly asks for "long video", "multi-scene", "story", or duration > 10s | `scripts/video/generate_long_video.sh` (multi-segment) |

**Default behavior:** Always use single-segment `generate_video.sh` with **duration 10s and resolution 768P** unless the user explicitly asks for a long video, multi-scene video, or specifies a total duration exceeding 10 seconds. Do NOT automatically split into multiple segments — a single 10s video is the standard output. Only use `generate_long_video.sh` when the user clearly needs multi-scene or longer content.

Entry point (single video): `scripts/video/generate_video.sh`
Entry point (long/multi-scene): `scripts/video/generate_long_video.sh`

### Video Model Constraints (MUST follow)

**Duration limits by model and resolution:**

| Model | 720P | 768P | 1080P |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3 | - | 6s or **10s** | 6s only |
| MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3-Fast | - | 6s or **10s** | 6s only |
| MiniMax-Hailuo-02 | - | 6s or **10s** | 6s only |
| T2V-01 / T2V-01-Director | 6s only | - | - |
| I2V-01 / I2V-01-Director / I2V-01-live | 6s only | - | - |
| S2V-01 (ref) | 6s only | - | - |

**Resolution options by model and duration:**

| Model | 6s | 10s |
|-------|-----|-----|
| MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3 | 768P (default), 1080P | 768P only |
| MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3-Fast | 768P (default), 1080P | 768P only |
| MiniMax-Hailuo-02 | 512P, 768P (default), 1080P | 512P, 768P (default) |
| Other models | 720P (default) | Not supported |

**Key rules:**
- **Default: 10s + 768P** (best balance of length and quality for MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3)
- 1080P only supports 6s duration — if user requests 1080P, set `--duration 6`
- 10s duration only works with 768P (or 512P on Hailuo-02) — never combine 10s + 1080P
- Older models (T2V-01, I2V-01, S2V-01) only support 6s at 720P

### IMPORTANT: Prompt Optimization (MUST follow before generating any video)

Before calling any video generation script, you MUST optimize the user's prompt by reading and applying `references/video-prompt-guide.md`. Never pass the user's raw description directly as `--prompt`.

**Optimization steps:**

1. **Apply the Professional Formula**: `Main subject + Scene + Movement + Camera motion + Aesthetic atmosphere`
   - BAD: `"A puppy in a park"`
   - GOOD: `"A golden retriever puppy runs toward the camera on a sun-dappled grass path in a park, [跟随] smooth tracking shot, warm golden hour lighting, shallow depth of field, joyful atmosphere"`

2. **Add camera instructions** using `[指令]` syntax: `[推进]`, `[拉远]`, `[跟随]`, `[固定]`, `[左摇]`, etc.

3. **Include aesthetic details**: lighting (golden hour, dramatic side lighting), color grading (warm tones, cinematic), texture (dust particles, rain droplets), atmosphere (intimate, epic, peaceful)

4. **Keep to 1-2 key actions** for 6-10 second videos — do not overcrowd with events

5. **For i2v mode** (image-to-video): Focus prompt on **movement and change only**, since the image already establishes the visual. Do NOT re-describe what's in the image.
   - BAD: `"A lake with mountains"` (just repeating the image)
   - GOOD: `"Gentle ripples spread across the water surface, a breeze rustles the distant trees, [固定] fixed camera, soft morning light, peaceful and serene"`

6. **For multi-segment long videos**: Each segment's prompt must be self-contained and optimized individually. The i2v segments (segment 2+) should describe motion/change relative to the previous segment's ending frame.

```bash
# Text-to-video (default: 10s, 768P)
bash scripts/video/generate_video.sh \
  --mode t2v \
  --prompt "A golden retriever puppy bounds toward the camera on a sunlit grass path, [跟随] tracking shot, warm golden hour, shallow depth of field, joyful" \
  --output minimax-output/puppy.mp4

# Text-to-video with 1080P (must use --duration 6)
bash scripts/video/generate_video.sh \
  --mode t2v \
  --prompt "A golden retriever puppy bounds toward the camera" \
  --duration 6 --resolution 1080P \
  --output minimax-output/puppy_hd.mp4

# Image-to-video (prompt focuses on MOTION, not image content)
bash scripts/video/generate_video.sh \
  --mode i2v \
  --prompt "The petals begin to sway gently in the breeze, soft light shifts across the surface, [固定] fixed framing, dreamy pastel tones" \
  --first-frame photo.jpg \
  --output minimax-output/animated.mp4

# Start-end frame interpolation (sef mode uses MiniMax-Hailuo-02)
bash scripts/video/generate_video.sh \
  --mode sef \
  --first-frame start.jpg --last-frame end.jpg \
  --output minimax-output/transition.mp4

# Subject reference (face consistency, ref mode uses S2V-01, 6s only)
bash scripts/video/generate_video.sh \
  --mode ref \
  --prompt "A young woman in a white dress walks slowly through a sunlit garden, [跟随] smooth tracking, warm natural lighting, cinematic depth of field" \
  --subject-image face.jpg \
  --duration 6 \
  --output minimax-output/person.mp4
```

### Long-form Video (Multi-scene)

Multi-scene long videos chain segments together: the first segment generates via text-to-video (t2v), then each subsequent segment uses the last frame of the previous segment as its first frame (i2v). Segments are joined with crossfade transitions for smooth continuity. Default is 10 seconds per segment.

**Workflow:**
1. Segment 1: t2v — generated purely from the optimized text prompt
2. Segment 2+: i2v — the previous segment's last frame becomes `first_frame_image`, prompt describes **motion and change from that ending state**
3. All segments are concatenated with 0.5s crossfade transitions to eliminate jump cuts
4. Optional: AI-generated background music is overlaid

**Prompt rules for each segment:**
- Each segment prompt MUST be independently optimized using the Professional Formula
- Segment 1 (t2v): Full scene description with subject, scene, camera, atmosphere
- Segment 2+ (i2v): Focus on **what changes and moves** from the previous ending frame. Do NOT repeat the visual description — the first frame already provides it
- Maintain visual consistency: keep lighting, color grading, and style keywords consistent across segments
- Each segment covers only 10 seconds of action — keep it focused

```bash
# Example: 3-segment story with optimized per-segment prompts (default: 10s/segment, 768P)
bash scripts/video/generate_long_video.sh \
  --scenes \
    "A lone astronaut stands on a red desert planet surface, wind blowing dust particles, [推进] slow push in toward the visor, dramatic rim lighting, cinematic sci-fi atmosphere" \
    "The astronaut turns and begins walking toward a distant glowing structure on the horizon, dust swirling around boots, [跟随] tracking from behind, vast desolate landscape, golden light from the structure" \
    "The astronaut reaches the structure entrance, a massive doorway pulses with blue energy, [推进] slow push in toward the doorway, light reflects off the visor, awe-inspiring epic scale" \
  --music-prompt "cinematic orchestral ambient, slow build, sci-fi atmosphere" \
  --output minimax-output/long_video.mp4

# With custom settings
bash scripts/video/generate_long_video.sh \
  --scenes "Scene 1 prompt" "Scene 2 prompt" \
  --segment-duration 10 \
  --resolution 768P \
  --crossfade 0.5 \
  --music-prompt "calm ambient background music" \
  --output minimax-output/long_video.mp4
```

### Add Background Music

```bash
bash scripts/video/add_bgm.sh \
  --video input.mp4 \
  --generate-bgm --instrumental \
  --music-prompt "soft piano background" \
  --bgm-volume 0.3 \
  --output minimax-output/output_with_bgm.mp4
```

### Template Video

```bash
bash scripts/video/generate_template_video.sh \
  --template-id 392753057216684038 \
  --media photo.jpg \
  --output minimax-output/template_output.mp4
```

### Video Models

| Mode | Default Model | Default Duration | Default Resolution | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| t2v | MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3 | 10s | 768P | Latest text-to-video |
| i2v | MiniMax-Hailuo-2.3 | 10s | 768P | Latest image-to-video |
| sef | MiniMax-Hailuo-02 | 6s | 768P | Start-end frame |

## Media Tools (Audio/Video Processing)

Entry point: `scripts/media_tools.sh`

Standalone FFmpeg-based utilities for format conversion, concatenation, extraction, trimming, and audio overlay. Use these when the user needs to process existing media files without generating new content via MiniMax API.

### Video Format Conversion

```bash
# Convert between formats (mp4, mov, webm, mkv, avi, ts, flv)
bash scripts/media_tools.sh convert-video input.webm -o output.mp4
bash scripts/media_tools.sh convert-video input.mp4 -o output.mov

# With quality / resolution / fps options
bash scripts/media_tools.sh convert-video input.mp4 -o output.mp4 \
  --crf 18 --preset medium --resolution 1920x1080 --fps 30
```

### Audio Format Conversion

```bash
# Convert between formats (mp3, wav, flac, ogg, aac, m4a, opus, wma)
bash scripts/media_tools.sh convert-audio input.wav -o output.mp3
bash scripts/media_tools.sh convert-audio input.mp3 -o output.flac \
  --bitrate 320k --sample-rate 48000 --channels 2
```

### Video Concatenation

```bash
# Concatenate with crossfade transition (default 0.5s)
bash scripts/media_tools.sh concat-video seg1.mp4 seg2.mp4 seg3.mp4 -o merged.mp4

# Hard cut (no crossfade)
bash scripts/media_tools.sh concat-video seg1.mp4 seg2.mp4 -o merged.mp4 --crossfade 0
```

### Audio Concatenation

```bash
# Simple concatenation
bash scripts/media_tools.sh concat-audio part1.mp3 part2.mp3 -o combined.mp3

# With crossfade
bash scripts/media_tools.sh concat-audio part1.mp3 part2.mp3 -o combined.mp3 --crossfade 1
```

### Extract Audio from Video

```bash
# Extract as mp3
bash scripts/media_tools.sh extract-audio video.mp4 -o audio.mp3

# Extract as wav with higher bitrate
bash scripts/media_tools.sh extract-audio video.mp4 -o audio.wav --bitrate 320k
```

### Video Trimming

```bash
# Trim by start/end time (seconds)
bash scripts/media_tools.sh trim-video input.mp4 -o clip.mp4 --start 5 --end 15

# Trim by start + duration
bash scripts/media_tools.sh trim-video input.mp4 -o clip.mp4 --start 10 --duration 8
```

### Add Audio to Video (Overlay / Replace)

```bash
# Mix audio with existing video audio
bash scripts/media_tools.sh add-audio --video video.mp4 --audio bgm.mp3 -o output.mp4 \
  --volume 0.3 --fade-in 2 --fade-out 3

# Replace original audio entirely
bash scripts/media_tools.sh add-audio --video video.mp4 --audio narration.mp3 -o output.mp4 \
  --replace
```

### Media File Info

```bash
bash scripts/media_tools.sh probe input.mp4
```
